# FastAPI Sepsis Prediction Application Containerized with Docker and Integrated with a Machine Learning Model

## Objective Of This Project

The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model for sepsis classification and deploy it as a web application using FastAPI, enabling real-time predictions.

## Setup

You need to have Python 3 on your system (a Python version lower than 3.10). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's root :: repository_name> ... follow the steps below:

Linux & MacOs:

  python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main app (being at the repository root):
